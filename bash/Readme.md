# Bash dotfiles

Though there are numerous awesome ready to be cloned dotfiles repos out there.
[Famous Zach's](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) repo, 
[coolness from Paul Irish](https://github.com/paulirish/dotfiles) and the origins of it, and many others.

I wanted to at least partially understand what I have in mine, and so it mostly is cherry-picked stuff from Paul Irish's collection.

Awesome `z.sh` is from https://github.com/rupa/z/commits/master, unchanged.

And the `.git-prompt.sh` is from https://github.com/lyze/posh-git-sh, with slight modification in color definitions (`echo -e "\033[1;33mColorized"` works, while `echo -e "\e[1;33mColor"` doesn't).

There is also [git-completion.bash](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash), which together with git-prompt gives comparable experience to [posh-git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git), that I had to have in bash.
